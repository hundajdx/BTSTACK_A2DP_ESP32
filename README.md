# BTSTACK_A2DP_ESP32
Btstack port example A2DP Bluetooth Speaker with I2S, it is more ported Btstack to Arduino IDE, working pairing extension, it is experimental.

Project is still in development stage. I successfully tested with XIAOMI REDMI NOTE 4. Fixed problem with pairing, but nothing is guaranteed. 
Code is little bit dirty...
